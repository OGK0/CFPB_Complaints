# CFPB_Complaints

This repository contains my Natural Language Processing (NLP) work for customer complaints from the CFPB database.

I've included a Jupyter notebook that performs text classification on the complaints using Tensorflow/Keras, and hope to publish version that does this using Pytorch soon.
