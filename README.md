# CFPB_Complaints

This repository contains my Natural Language Processing (NLP) work for customer complaints from the CFPB database.

I've included a Jupyter notebook that performs text classification on the complaints using Tensorflow/Keras.

There is a also a version that uses DistilBERT (Pytorch) using Transformers.
